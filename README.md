# Collab
## Description
Collab is a productivity app that helps teachers increase their efficacy by enabling intra- and inter-collaboration amongst course teams. In a general sense, Collab could be used for members of teams within a larger enterprise working towards a common goal.

Users are able to read all posts or access a particular post, create a post, edit a post, and delete a post. Users are also able to view, hide, add, and delete a comment for a post. Collab encourages teachers/teammates to communicate in an organized way and also promotes efficiency by allowing them to stay connected.
